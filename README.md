# FOSS Setup
A repository containing a wide list of recommended software to achieve a fully-functioning technical presence based on FOSS (free [as in freedom], open source software), with digital privacy and security as priorities. Each app or service will have the following information listed:
1. On the left of the name will be an emoji, indicating the operating system supported. a üñ•Ô∏è symbol means that the software works on Linux (primarily Fedora 40 KDE spin, as that is what I use), a üì± symbol represents that the software works on Android phones OR GrapheneOS, an alternative privacy-focused Android fork, and the symbol üõú represents that it supports both Android and Linux. Software may also support other operating systems, such as Windows or iPhones, but they will not be indicated here. All Android software will work on phones that are unrooted.
2. Each listing will have the name of the software, which will be a link back to the main page of it. This will be the official website of the software, if one exists. If none exists, then the github will be linked. If there is no github page, the most relevant page I can find will be linked.
3. On the right of the name may or may not be üêê icon. If present, it means I personally use or have used it and can vouch for it. If not, then I have heard good enough things for it to be included, but I have not personally used it.
4. Under the name will first be listed if the app is Gratis (meaning free of cost), Freemium, Paid, and/or self-hostable. If there is no ability to use the service indefinitely without money, it will be considered paid. If you can, but with some features locked behind paying, it will be considered freemium. If there is no payment except for minor features (such as a donation badge) then it will be considered free. Self-Hostable will be an additional tag applied to any software which can be self-hosted. For example, Zotero has most features free, some behind a paywall, and the ability to self-host to gain all features for free. It would be marked as Freemium, Self-Hostable.
5. Next to the payment model of the software will be a quick listing of methods of download. These can include (non-exhaustive): F-Droid repository, Izzyondroid repository, Google Play Store, side-loaded APK file, AppImages, Snap, Flatpak, RPM repository, Fedora 40 KDE repository, custom repository, etc. Only one-two will be listed per app, with AppImages, Snap, and side-loaded APKs being de-prioritized over the others.
6. Next, each entry will either be marked "FOSS Frontend" or "Fully FOSS." Freetube, for example, is a FOSS frontend of Youtube. Youtube itself is in no way FOSS, but Freetube provides a way to access it using a FOSS frontend, and thus is marked as a FOSS Frontend. Peertube, on the other hand, is a FOSS Youtube alternative, and as such will be labelled Fully FOSS.
7. Finally, each entry will be marked as "Active" "Intermittent Development" or "Inactive", depending on how actively updates are pushed. Different software will have different levels of leniency here, as some software simply needs updates more often than others.
8. A little information will be given under each listing about it, as well as tips

Note: Software may be listed under multiple sections, should they be relevant to more than one.

# Software Stores/Finders
These are software capable of discovering other software and/or download other software. These recommendations can be used in tandem with one another to obtain most other apps on this list, and as such they are listed first. 

- ### üñ•Ô∏è [Discover](https://apps.kde.org/discover/) üêê
   *Gratis, Fedora 40 KDE Repository, Fully FOSS, Active*  
   The Discover store is the main store when using the KDE desktop environment. It allows you to install software from a wide variety of repositories, as well as search for software by category, and read reviews. Overall an effective software store.
- ### üì± [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/)
   *Gratis, Side-loaded APK OR F-Droid repository, Fully FOSS, Active*  
   F-Droid allows you to, shockingly, download apps from the F-Droid repository, as well as other repositories if you add them. A great solution to download FOSS apps on your phone.
- ### üì± [Droidify](https://github.com/Droid-ify/client) üêê
   *Gratis, Side-loaded APK OR F-Droid repository, Fully FOSS, Active*  
   Droidify is an alternative app for downloading apps on your phone, with a high number of repositories included (most notably F-Droid and IzzyonDroid) as well as Material You theming. Very pretty, very functional.
 - ### üì± [Obtainium](https://github.com/ImranR98/Obtainium) üêê
   *Gratis, F-Droid repository, Fully FOSS, Active*  
   An app that allows you to compile and obtain apps directly from Github, removing the middle-man of an app like F-Droid or Droidify. Also very useful for apps that simply are not in any repository.

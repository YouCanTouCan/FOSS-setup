# FOSS Setup
A repository containing a wide list of recommended software to achieve a fully-functioning technical presence based on FOSS (free [as in freedom], open source software), with digital privacy and security as priorities. Each app or service will have the following information listed:
1. On the left of the name will be an emoji, indicating the operating system supported. a üñ•Ô∏è symbol means that the software works on Linux (primarily Fedora 40 KDE spin, as that is what I use), a üì± symbol represents that the software works on Android phones OR GrapheneOS, an alternative privacy-focused Android fork, and the symbol üõú represents that it supports both Android and Linux. Software may also support other operating systems, such as Windows or iPhones, but they will not be indicated here. All Android software will work on phones that are unrooted.
2. Each listing will have the name of the software, which will be a link back to the main page of it. This will be the official website of the software, if one exists. If none exists, then the github will be linked. If there is no github page, the most relevant page I can find will be linked.
3. On the right of the name may or may not be üêê icon. If present, it means I personally use it and can vouch for it. If not, then I have heard good enough things for it to be included, or used to use it, but I do not anymore.
4. Under the name will first be listed if the app is Gratis (meaning free of cost), Freemium, Paid, and/or self-hostable. If there is no ability to use the service indefinitely without money, it will be considered paid. If you can, but with some features locked behind paying, it will be considered freemium. If there is no payment except for minor features (such as a donation badge) then it will be considered free. Self-Hostable will be an additional tag applied to any software which can be self-hosted. For example, Zotero has most features free, some behind a paywall, and the ability to self-host to gain all features for free. It would be marked as Freemium, Self-Hostable.
5. Next to the payment model of the software will be a quick listing of methods of download. These can include (non-exhaustive): F-Droid repository, Izzyondroid repository, Google Play Store, side-loaded APK file, AppImages, Snap, Flatpak, RPM repository, Fedora 40 KDE repository, custom repository, etc. Only one-two will be listed per app, with AppImages, Snap, and side-loaded APKs being de-prioritized over the others.
6. Next, each entry will either be marked "FOSS Frontend" or "Fully FOSS." Freetube, for example, is a FOSS frontend of Youtube. Youtube itself is in no way FOSS, but Freetube provides a way to access it using a FOSS frontend, and thus is marked as a FOSS Frontend. Peertube, on the other hand, is a FOSS Youtube alternative, and as such will be labelled Fully FOSS.
7. Next, each entry will be marked as "Active" "Intermittent Development" or "Inactive", depending on how actively updates are pushed. Different software will have different levels of leniency here, as some software simply needs updates more often than others.
8. Finally, software with android support will be marked as "Shizuku-Enhanced", "Shizuku-Required", or "Default-Permissions". Apps that provide extra features if you use Shizuku will be marked as Shizuku-Enhanced, apps that only provide functionality with Shizuku will be marked as "Shizuku-Required", and apps with no special features for those who use Shizuku will be marked as "Default-Permissions." 
9. A little information will be given under each listing about it, as well as tips

Note: Software may be listed under multiple sections, should they be relevant to more than one.

# Software Stores, Managers, and Finders
These are software capable of discovering other software and/or download other software. These recommendations can be used in tandem with one another to obtain most other apps on this list.

   *Gratis, Fedora 40 KDE Repository, Fully FOSS, Active*

# Android Launchers
The launcher of a phone basically controls what your home screen looks like. It's important to find one that works well for your workflow.

- ### üì± [Neo Launcher](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Launcher)
   *Gratis, F-Droid repository, Fully FOSS, Active, Default Permissions*  
   A launcher that replicates much of the GUI of the default pixel launcher. If you want a traditional experience but FOSS, this is likely your go-to.
- ### üì± [Kiss Launcher](https://kisslauncher.com/)
   *Gratis, F-Droid repository, Fully FOSS, Active, Default Permissions*  
   Another search-based launcher. Extremely powerful search bar allowing you to find apps and more on your phone easily. In my humble opinion, much worse widget support than Kvaesitso.

   *Gratis, F-Droid repository, Fully FOSS, Intermittent Development, Default Permissions*  
   A very customizable keyboard, even moreso than Heliboard. However, lacks swipe typing for those who use it.

# VPNs
VPNs, or Virtual Private Networks, are services that provide a proxy between your device and your internet traffic. The privacy implications of this are often overstated, but it can help to a certain degree, and it can also prevent geoblocking of content.

- ### üõú [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en)
   *Paid, Flatpak OR F-Droid repository, Fully FOSS, Active, Default Permissions*  
   Likely the best VPN out there for privacy reasons, as they have a proven track record (not just promised track record) of keeping no logs.
- ### üõú [Proton VPN](https://protonvpn.com/)
   *Paid, Flatpak OR F-Droid repository, Fully FOSS, Active, Default Permissions*  
   Another really great VPN, that has long-promised and been audited to be keeping no logs. Unlike Mullvad, supports port forwarding, which is useful when torrenting for example.

# DNS
DNS, or Domain Name System, can be likened to a phonebook - it basically tells your phone what website is what, and more. Full transparency, I'm fuzzy on the details.

- ### üõú [NextDNS](https://nextdns.io/) üêê
   *Freemium & Self-Hostable, CLI only, Fully FOSS, Intermittent Development, Default Permissions*

   *Gratis, Fedora 40 KDE Repository OR Google Play Store, Fully FOSS, Active, Default Permissions*

  - ### üñ•Ô∏è [Arkenfox](https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js) üêê
    *Gratis, Manual Installation from Github, Fully FOSS, Active*  
    A custom config you can enable in the default Firefox app (so you still get Mozilla's quick security updates) that hardens the browser to make it extremely privacy-focused. Still has all the functionality of default Firefox, but with much superior privacy.
  - ### üñ•Ô∏è [Betterfox](https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox)
    *Gratis, Manual Installation from Github, Fully FOSS, Active*  
    A custom config you can enable in the default Firefox app (so you still get Mozilla's quick security updates) that provides greater privacy, speed, and efficiency. Breaks less sites when compared to Arkenfox, but is far less private.
- ### üñ•Ô∏è [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/browser)
   *Gratis, Flatpak, Fully FOSS, Active*  
   A fork of Firefox built to bring fingerprinting to an absolute minimal while still using the clearnet (unlike Tor). Makes you practically invisible if you don't sign in, but you should not customize it in any way whatsoever or you will break your privacy.
- ### üñ•Ô∏è [Librewolf](https://librewolf.net/)
   *Gratis, Flatpak, Fully FOSS, Active*  
   A fork of Firefox that is hardened by default - sort of like Arkenfox, but with every so slightly slower security updates, ever so slightly less extension support, but it is all set up for you.
- ### üñ•Ô∏è [Floorp](https://floorp.app/en/)
   *Gratis, Flatpak, Fully FOSS, Active*

   *Gratis, Side-Loaded APK, Fully FOSS, Active, Default Permissions*

   *Gratis, AppImage OR F-Droid Repository, Fully FOSS, Active, Default Permissions*  
   A browser built to minimize fingerprinting and reroute all traffic through the Tor Network. Also allows you to access .onion sites. DO NOT edit your browser in any way, shape, or form, outside of setting it to Safest mode or you will be fingerprintable. Extremely slow, but the absolute best for privacy.

- ### üì± [Orbot](https://guardianproject.info/apps/org.torproject.android/) üêê
   *Gratis, Guardian Project Repository, Fully FOSS, Active, Default Permissions*
